# Shambhavi-langgraph-MAT496
## Setup:
Followed the instructions in the README to create an environment and install dependencies.
## Module 1 Lesson 1-Motivation:
- Many LLM applications use control flow which forms a chain which is very reliable because they use same control flow every time.
- Agent is a control flow determined by an LLM  
- When we go from a simple agent (router) to complex (autonomous) the application reliability decreases and the level of control increases.

- We can balance reliability with langgraph
- Langgraph has persistance, streaming, human-in-the-loop and controllability.
- Langgraph comes with an IDE which helps you visulaise and debug the agents that you build.
- Towards the end of the video, modules and their overview has been discussed.
